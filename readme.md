# Random Animals
_It's for someone speshial who can't decide which animal is in that specific moment. I Love You_

##Why

Because I wanted to learn to use javascript, I have some (little) background in Python and Java and if you want to do something on the web javascript is a must.

I just needed the right little project.
 
 
####"hacks"
This page is build with some URL 'hacks' for search and display images. Find them



##How

This site uses [Flickr API](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/) to search images about an animal species, randomly selected from owl, otter, alpaca, frog and cat and then display a random image selected from the response (you can always go to the original image, otherwhise is a bug, drop in to make an issue).  
[jQuery](http://jquery.com/) for manipulation and animations of the page.  
[Crossroad.js](http://millermedeiros.github.io/crossroads.js/) + [Hasher](https://github.com/millermedeiros/Hasher) for the fancy URLs action

You can find the icons at [Game-Icons](http://game-icons.net/), the spinning icon is from [Preloaders](http://preloaders.net/)
